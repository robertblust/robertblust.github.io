"""Generate one narration clip per slide, per language, straight from the decks.

The deck is the only source: index.html holds both the spoken text and, in the
<em class='cue'> directions, the places the author meant to pause. A cue becomes a
paragraph break, and its data-tag becomes an eleven_v3 audio tag.

This repository serves two talks, so there is one generator rather than a copy per
deck — the two copies of the PDF exporter it was imported alongside had already drifted
apart, which is the argument for not doing that again. Clips land next to the deck they
belong to, at talks/<slug>/audio/<lang>/<nn>.mp3, which is what each deck's clipUrl()
already builds.

Both are nudges, not controls. Measured on slide 04: a [slowly] tag moved the
speaking rate 9% (EN) / 4% (DE), paragraph breaks and ellipses 2%, and the
voice_settings `speed` field — accepted by the API — changed nothing at all on
this model. Real pauses would have to be silence between separate clips, owned
by the player rather than requested from the model. Don't reach for `speed`.

Skips a clip whose text has not changed since it was last generated, so editing
one note does not cost a full regeneration.

# the person do not sound like the same speaker.
#
# Changing either reprices only that language: the clip cache keys on

# from 120 ms to 20-70 ms. That finding was made on Jessica and Matilda, and these are
# different voices on purpose, so it does not transfer by assumption. polish() below treats
# the burst on the way to disk regardless of the setting, which is what makes leaving this
# at 0.45 a decision rather than a postponement: audition before moving it.
