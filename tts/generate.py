"""Generate one narration clip per slide, per language, straight from the decks.

The deck is the only source: index.html holds both the spoken text and, in the
<em class='cue'> directions, the places the author meant to pause. A cue becomes a
paragraph break, and its data-tag becomes an eleven_v3 audio tag.

This repository serves two talks, so there is one generator rather than a copy per
deck — the two copies of the PDF exporter it was imported alongside had already drifted
apart, which is the argument for not doing that again. Clips land next to the deck they
belong to, at talks/<slug>/audio/<lang>/<nn>.mp3, which is what each deck's clipUrl()
already builds.

Both are nudges, not controls. Measured on slide 04: a [slowly] tag moved the
speaking rate 9% (EN) / 4% (DE), paragraph breaks and ellipses 2%, and the
voice_settings `speed` field — accepted by the API — changed nothing at all on
this model. Real pauses would have to be silence between separate clips, owned
by the player rather than requested from the model. Don't reach for `speed`.

Skips a clip whose text has not changed since it was last generated, so editing
one note does not cost a full regeneration.

    written the other way round and had to flip with the decks — if it is ever wrong, the

    catches. `--dry-run` is the guard: the clip cache keys on the text, so a swap shows up
    immediately as every clip needing regeneration.

    Parsed by scanning for the tag's real closing '>' rather than with a regex: the data-de
