// Render each deck to a 16:9 PDF fallback, one slide per page, in both languages.

// Usage: npm run pdf

// Which decks there are and what their files are called is the only thing that varies between
// this site and its two siblings, so it is the only thing that lives here. The rendering is
// `@robertblust/design/decks/export`; the package imports neither Playwright nor pdf-lib, so
// both are handed in from this file.
