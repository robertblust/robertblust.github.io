// The design system, expressed as assertions.
//
// These three repositories share no stylesheet, and cannot: a deck has to open from
// file://, so there is nothing to import. The tokens are therefore a copy inside every
// page, and this file is what stops the copies drifting *within* a repository.
//
// The token, header and stage blocks are now generated from @robertblust/design and
// asserted byte-for-byte by `design:check` against the one source the package ships.
// That makes `tokenVersion` below no longer the tripwire — it is a second, cheaper
// opinion, worth keeping because it catches a page the sync never visited at all,
// which a byte comparison over the pages that exist cannot.
//
// What this file asserts, in the order the checks are defined below:
//   fontsLoaded     a declared family is really loaded, measured rather than believed
//   fontsAvailable  every family named anywhere is self-hosted or a system face
//   tokens          the palette's vocabulary and its values
//   sky             the one gradient, declared *and* painted by the body
//   header          the lockup, the nav and the header's own metrics, measured
//   monoScope       mono means data, and nothing else
//   contrast        the text colours clear their ratios on --ground
//   tokenVersion    the page's `design tokens · vN` marker matches this suite
//   fences          presence of every fence a page declares, version-blind
//   fenceOrder      the fences a page declares appear in the order it says they must
//   lockupCollapses at a narrow viewport, `.name` renders display:none — a cascade outcome,
//                   asserted by rendering, not by reading which fence comes first
//
// footerVersion and its FOOTER_VERSION constant are gone, not retargeted. The deck footer's
// old open-ended `deck footer · vN` marker is replaced by three closed fences — `deck
// transport`, `deck lockup`, `deck fit` — and what now catches a deck whose fence lags the
// pinned release is `design:check`, not a version check here: it compares each fence's bytes
// against the installed package, and the version is part of those bytes. That is strictly
// stronger than FOOTER_VERSION ever was, because the constant had to be hand-edited in three
// repositories to stay true — the very drift it existed to catch. `fences` (below) still
// matches only `· v\d+` and asserts presence, not version, exactly as it always has; the
// version comparison lives in `design:check` alone.

// Read from the package rather than kept in step by hand. TOKEN_VERSION used to be a fourth
// hand-typed copy of the number in versions.json — the page's fence, the block's own opening
// line, and this constant all had to agree, and they only did because someone typed them to
// agree. A token release would bump the first two and leave this one behind until someone
// hand-edited it in three repositories, which is precisely the habit generating the blocks was
// supposed to retire. Deriving it means tokenVersion below now catches what it is meant to: a
// page whose fence is behind the package, not a suite that quietly stopped agreeing with itself.
