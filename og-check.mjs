// Does each share card still show the page it was rendered from?
//
// Usage: npm run og:check
//
// It renders nothing and imports nothing outside node's standard library, so CI can run it
// before `npm ci` — and a stale card is then caught by the cheapest step in the job rather
// than by whoever notices the preview.
//
// It over-reports and never under-reports, deliberately. Editing a comment in a page marks its
// card stale even though the render would be identical. Clearing that is `npm run og` and a
// commit — cheap, and the opposite error is a card nobody notices for days.

// that passes one argument.
